Originally from **Ghana**, I moved to Moscow, ID in Spring 2024 to study [**Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/bcb) in the [**University of Idaho**](https://www.uidaho.edu/). My first and second degrees were in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics respectively, all in the [University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani, Ghana](https://www.uenr.edu.gh/).

This blog gives updates on the presence of the various strains of COVID-19 in the US population. The data isn't real, and is generated using a periodic function and is just created for the purposes of the course: **BCB 520: Foundations of Data Visualization**.
